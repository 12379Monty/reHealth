## Using the Files Together

1. **View reports**: Open the `.md` files in any text editor, or use the `.html` file for formatted viewing in a browser.

2. **Convert markdown to HTML**: Follow the instructions in `markdown_rendering_instructions.md`, using the `style.css` file for consistent formatting.

3. **Track symptoms**: Print or copy the `symptom_tracker.md` into your preferred format for daily/weekly use.

4. **Daily management**: Use the `self_care_checklist.md` as a daily reference for managing your condition.

## Additional Notes

- All markdown files can be viewed in any text editor, but for proper formatting, use a markdown-aware editor like Visual Studio Code, Typora, or an online markdown viewer.

- To update the HTML file after modifying any markdown file, follow the instructions in the `markdown_rendering_instructions.md` document.

- For printing, the HTML version generally provides better formatting control than printing directly from markdown.

- Keep the `change_log.md` updated if you make any personal modifications to these files for your own use.
