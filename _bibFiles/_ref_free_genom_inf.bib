	abstract = {We introduce SPLASH2, a fast, scalable implementation of SPLASH based on an efficient k-mer counting approach for regulated sequence variation detection in massive datasets from a wide range of sequencing technologies and biological contexts. We demonstrate biological discovery by SPLASH2 in single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data and in bulk RNA-seq data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, including unannotated alternative splicing in cancer transcriptomes and sensitive detection of circular RNA.},

@article{Baharav:2024aa,
	abstract = {Contingency tables, data represented as counts matrices, are ubiquitous across quantitative research and data-science applications. Existing statistical tests are insufficient however, as none are simultaneously computationally efficient and statistically valid for a finite number of observations. In this work, motivated by a recent application in reference-free genomic inference [K. Chaung et al., Cell 186, 5440-5456 (2023)], we develop Optimized Adaptive Statistic for Inferring Structure (OASIS), a family of statistical tests for contingency tables. OASIS constructs a test statistic which is linear in the normalized data matrix, providing closed-form P-value bounds through classical concentration inequalities. In the process, OASIS provides a decomposition of the table, lending interpretability to its rejection of the null. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the OASIS test statistic, showing that these finite-sample bounds correctly characterize the test statistic's P-value up to a variance term. Experiments on genomic sequencing data highlight the power and interpretability of OASIS. Using OASIS, we develop a method that can detect SARS-CoV-2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains de novo, which existing approaches cannot achieve. We demonstrate in simulations that OASIS is robust to overdispersion, a common feature in genomic data like single-cell RNA sequencing, where under accepted noise models OASIS provides good control of the false discovery rate, while Pearson's [Formula: see text] consistently rejects the null. Additionally, we show in simulations that OASIS is more powerful than Pearson's [Formula: see text] in certain regimes, including for some important two group alternatives, which we corroborate with approximate power calculations.},

@article{Chaung:2023aa,
	abstract = {Today's genomics workflows typically require alignment to a reference sequence, which limits discovery. We introduce a unifying paradigm, SPLASH (Statistically Primary aLignment Agnostic Sequence Homing), which directly analyzes raw sequencing data, using a statistical test to detect a signature of regulation: sample-specific sequence variation. SPLASH detects many types of variation and can be efficiently run at scale. We show that SPLASH identifies complex mutation patterns in SARS-CoV-2, discovers regulated RNA isoforms at the single-cell level, detects the vast sequence diversity of adaptive immune receptors, and uncovers biology in non-model organisms undocumented in their reference genomes: geographic and seasonal variation and diatom association in eelgrass, an oceanic plant impacted by climate change, and tissue-specific transcripts in octopus. SPLASH is a unifying approach to genomic analysis that enables expansive discovery without metadata or references.},
