 Let me search for information specifically about venous insufficiency associated with non-injection cocaine use (snorting or smoking).Let me search more specifically for cocaine's systemic vascular effects that might relate to venous insufficiency regardless of route of administration.Based on my search, here's what is known about the association between venous insufficiency and chronic cocaine use through non-injection routes (snorting or smoking):

## The Current State of Knowledge

**Limited Direct Evidence**

A systematic review on cocaine and thrombosis found that their review did not highlight any papers studying the effect of cocaine upon venous vasculature specifically. The research literature has focused predominantly on arterial complications, with venous effects being relatively understudied regardless of route of administration.

**Systemic Vascular Effects**

However, cocaine does cause systemic vascular damage that theoretically could affect the venous system, even without injection:

The underlying mechanisms of cocaine's vascular effects are multifactorial, including hypertension, impaired homeostasis and platelet function, thrombosis, thromboembolism, and alterations in blood flow, with cocaine functioning as a powerful vasoconstrictor and causing endothelial dysfunction and accelerated atherosclerosis.

**Prothrombotic State**

Cocaine ingestion causes acute stress leading to endothelial damage, which promotes increases in fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor, leading to platelet aggregation and blood clot formation. Cocaine use is associated with a 40% increase in plasma von Willebrand factor concentration, suggesting that cocaine induces endothelial secretion and supports a role for platelet adhesion to the endothelium in cocaine-associated thrombosis.

**Venous Thromboembolism Cases**

There are documented cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cocaine users, though the route of administration isn't always specified. Case reports of patients experiencing venous thromboembolism in the setting of cocaine use suggest a possible association, with evidence that cocaine should be considered a provoking risk factor for venous thromboembolism.

## Bottom Line

While chronic cocaine use—regardless of route—appears to create a systemic prothrombotic state with endothelial dysfunction that *could* theoretically contribute to chronic venous insufficiency, **there is a striking lack of specific research on venous insufficiency in non-injection cocaine users**. The vast majority of documented venous insufficiency cases are in people who inject drugs, where direct mechanical vein damage is the primary mechanism. More research is needed to determine if chronic snorting or smoking of cocaine independently increases risk for chronic venous insufficiency through systemic vascular effects alone.
