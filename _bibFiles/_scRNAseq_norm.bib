@article{Ahlmann-Eltze:2023aa,
	abstract = {The count table, a numeric matrix of genes ×cells, is the basic input data structure in the analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data. A common preprocessing step is to adjust the counts for variable sampling efficiency and to transform them so that the variance is similar across the dynamic range. These steps are intended to make subsequent application of generic statistical methods more palatable. Here, we describe four transformation approaches based on the delta method, model residuals, inferred latent expression state and factor analysis. We compare their strengths and weaknesses and find that the latter three have appealing theoretical properties; however, in benchmarks using simulated and real-world data, it turns out that a rather simple approach, namely, the logarithm with a pseudo-count followed by principal-component analysis, performs as well or better than the more sophisticated alternatives. This result highlights limitations of current theoretical analysis as assessed by bottom-line performance benchmarks.},

@article{Melms:2021aa,
	abstract = {Respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection1,2, but the host response at the lung tissue level is poorly understood. Here we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing of about 116,000 nuclei from the lungs of nineteen individuals who died of COVID-19 and underwent rapid autopsy and seven control individuals. Integrated analyses identified substantial alterations in cellular composition, transcriptional cell states, and cell-to-cell interactions, thereby providing insight into the biology of lethal COVID-19. The lungs from individuals with COVID-19 were highly inflamed, with dense infiltration of aberrantly activated monocyte-derived macrophages and alveolar macrophages, but had impaired T cell responses. Monocyte/macrophage-derived interleukin-1βand epithelial cell-derived interleukin-6 were unique features of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to other viral and bacterial causes of pneumonia. Alveolar type 2 cells adopted an inflammation-associated transient progenitor cell state and failed to undergo full transition into alveolar type 1 cells, resulting in impaired lung regeneration. Furthermore, we identified expansion of recently described CTHRC1+ pathological fibroblasts3 contributing to rapidly ensuing pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19. Inference of protein activity and ligand--receptor interactions identified putative drug targets to disrupt deleterious circuits. This atlas enables the dissection of lethal COVID-19, may inform our understanding of long-term complications of COVID-19 survivors, and provides an important resource for therapeutic development.},

@article{Zeng:2024aa,
	abstract = {Single-cell sequencing is frequently affected by ``omission''due to limitations in sequencing throughput, yet bulk RNA-seq may contain these ostensibly ``omitted''cells. Here, we introduce the single cell trajectory blending from Bulk RNA-seq (BulkTrajBlend) algorithm, a component of the OmicVerse suite that leverages a Beta-Variational AutoEncoder for data deconvolution and graph neural networks for the discovery of overlapping communities. This approach effectively interpolates and restores the continuity of ``omitted''cells within single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Furthermore, OmicVerse provides an extensive toolkit for both bulk and single cell RNA-seq analysis, offering seamless access to diverse methodologies, streamlining computational processes, fostering exquisite data visualization, and facilitating the extraction of significant biological insights to advance scientific research.},
